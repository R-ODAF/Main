Omics Data Analysis Framework for Regulatory application


  
  
  
  
  
Dear future R-ODAF user,

The CEFIC project has developed Omics Data Analysis Frameworks for Regulatory application (R-ODAFs) in order to supply robust and reproducible data analysis pipelines for transcriptomics analysis. While developed for regulatory purposes, the pipelines can also be applied for research purposes.

This GitHub contains scripts/files nessesary for the sequencing R-ODAF (applicable for both RNA-Seq and TempO-seq technology).
The scripts/files nessesary for the Microarray R-ODAF can be found in the ArrayAnalysis repository: https://github.com/arrayanalysis/

Thank you for using the R-ODAF!

Kind Regards,
The CEFIC C4 team
